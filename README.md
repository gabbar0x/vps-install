# VPS-Install
 Quick script to install all the required tools over a VPS (tested on DEBIAN). It will install a Kali OS over the VPS and will install tools in a directory called "Tools". I run this script as "Root" and paths are hardcoded to "/root/Tools"

# Use

1. clone the repo.
2. run following command: sh vps_install.sh
3. Enjoy!
